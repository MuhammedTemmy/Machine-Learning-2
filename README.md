EXPLORING MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSIS ON THE SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE ILLNESS WITH DIAGNOSIS
# INTRODUCTION
Modern machine learning models are being used for disease detection and diagnosis, which is causing a revolution in the medical sciences. The use of algorithms to diagnose and offer information on problems like dementia, diabetes, and many types of cancer has shown a lot of promise in recent years, giving hope to the millions of people who experience these conditions. Many additional critical illnesses, including neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, may not yet have their secrets unlocked by the machine learning revolution because to the intricacy of these conditions and the paucity of available data. A dangerous and incapacitating mental illness, schizophrenia. There are varying degrees of social function faults, a slow and progressive development of the condition, and manifestations such as impediments to thinking, emotion, and action. False beliefs, clouded or muddled thinking, hearing voices that only you can hear, decreased social engagement and emotional expression, and lack of desire are all symptoms. It not only causes the sufferer enormous suffering, but it also places a significant cost on society and the family. Around 1% of the world's population has the disease. The majority of the datasets for these types of disorders that are now accessible are actually far too tiny to allow for the meaningful extraction of information, and many of these datasets show clear biases about the race, socioeconomic position, and severity of the participants' ailments. Real-world schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric condition characterized by cognitive symptoms, disorganized thinking, social disengagement, diminished emotional expression, and positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions). The information we'll look at is made up and mostly made up (poorer working memory and general cognitive ability). Schizophrenia affects 0.5% of people at some point in their lives, and it often first manifests around adolescence and the early years of adulthood. Schizophrenia can be made better through early detection, intervention, and therapy. The goal of the cure rate is to stop the disease from progressing slowly. The aetiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia are still unknown, and there aren't any objective laboratory diagnostic markers or equipment diagnostic criteria. Clinical diagnoses are mostly made using a patient's medical history, together with psychiatric symptoms, the disease's law of progression, and scales. The difficulty in making an early diagnosis of schizophrenia is still a result of the intricacy of the disease mechanism. Schizophrenia primarily affects persons between the ages of 15 and 34 and has a severe detrimental impact on human perception, thought, emotion, and conduct. Early controlled, late repeated attacks, and significantly compromised cognitive function are the features of this illness. Both hereditary and environmental factors raise the risk of developing schizophrenia. Recent research have connected a number of genes to the condition, but it is still unclear how the disorder is impacted by the mix of genetic and environmental factors. The aetiology of schizophrenia is the subject of numerous conflicting ideas, but the fundamental molecular causes of the illness are largely unknown. The diagnosis of schizophrenia must be made primarily on an individual's behaviour, their medical history, and long-term observations of functional impairment because there are no objective diagnostic tests for the condition. The way this process is carried out varies a lot between countries and even between different medical specialties. Schizophrenia is especially challenging to identify because of negative signs of the illness such social isolation, symptoms that match with those of other mental illnesses, and cases when sufferers do not immediately exhibit favourable signals. Some of the most frequent psychiatric diagnoses that people obtain initially include bipolar disease, borderline personality disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, which can result in poor treatment management. With enough high-quality data and a better biological understanding of such conditions, it is hoped that machine learning will one day be able to identify people who exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia more accurately than clinicians, which may aid in the treatment and prognosis of this crippling condition. It is essential that healthcare professionals and machine learning scientists/engineers collaborate in order to fully realise the incredible potential of machine learning in healthcare, while keeping in mind the potentially harmful limitations and side effects that using historical medical data brings limits and drawbacks associated with using previous medical data.

# UNDERSTANDING THE DATASET
This dataset contains information on the symptoms and manner of life of 5,000 hypothetical people. The data is contained in a single.csv file with the name "MS4S16 Dataset.csv." The file is comma-delimited and has 5,000 rows and 27 columns (a mixture of numerical and categorical features). If the observation has a value of 1, it refers to a "case," or a person who has the schizophrenia-like illness. If the observation has a value of 0, it refers to a "control," or a person who does not have the schizophrenia-like illness.

# CONCLUSION AND LIMITATION
Starting with the initial step and adding libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, StatsModels, Matplotlib, and other more libraries as we go with the analysis. To assure the calibre and objectivity of our research, we were able to input the dataset and check for missing values and infinities, which allowed us to clean up and obtain a new dataset. To examine several characteristics of the variables, we were able to plot some graphs, such as the distribution plot and the histogram plot, also calculate the skewness of the variables. In order for machine learning algorithms to use our category variables to provide more accurate predictions, we performed a OneHot Encoding to replace them with numerical variables.

Continuing with the Clustering using the K Means approach, choose my X and Y, take the diagnosis for the column in Y, drop Diagnosis solely, and keep other columns in X. This is from the Unsupervised learning analysis. Additionally, we divided the sets, used the MinMaxScaler to scale the data, and then used PCA to reduce the number of dimensions so that the findings could be displayed using a 2D scatter plot. checked the KMeans, the prediction, and the scatter plot visualisation.Elbow curve was used to determine the ideal cluster number (k), which we were able to obtain four (4). In order to evaluate the quality of clusters and confirm the optimal cluster, Silhouette scores were checked to demonstrate how successfully samples are clustered with comparable samples (k).

Futhermore, from the Supervised learning we made some prediction using Logistic regression technique and we were able to get the coefficient, the intercept and predicted the model regression which produces a matrix of probabilities that the expected output is equal to zero or one, can be used to evaluate the performance of a model after it has been defined. Also, made some model diagnosis, like confusion matrix where True Negative is 577, False Negative is 43, False Positive is 47 and True Positive is 583.In addition, we used a heat map to visualise the confusion by calculating the model's accuracy, which revealed that the model correctly predicted whether or not a person would default 92.8% of the time, 92.5% of the true positives to all positive values (true and false positives), 93.1% of the true positives to the sum of the true positives and false negatives, and 92.5% of the true positives to all positive values (true and false positives). Finally we made a classification report and a ROC curve to end.

# Limitations
We can attempt to perform some skewness to obtain some features and test for normality and do some tranformation like the Log transform, Root transform or Box-Cox transform, classify cases of schizophrenia-like disease from controls using supervised learning, and perform dimensionality reduction and hierarchical clustering for further investigation.
